You don't know, I do?\nI just feel so sick, I'm lost without you\n[Verse 4]\nI'm trapped in a deep love interstate\nLovestruck, car-by-car, there's no time to wait\nBut I tug on my heart from a view so afar\nA fan at the show, crying wild for a star\n[Verse 1]\nI wish you'd join me for a trip\nWe could go for cosmic brownies in my crazy rocket ship\nI don't know why you'd pick a guy like me\nWhen the world is full of oysters with their pearly white beads\n[Verse 2]\nOr I'd pick an egg so we could hatch it\nAnd fight off monsters, I'll grab the hatchet\nA big fucking shark with a million teeth\nAnd a million eyes, and also the shark has legs\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat do you want me to say?\nI'm sorry I was late for the date\nTen thousand eyes are on me\nDon't make me beg and plead\nWhat do you want me to say?\nI'm not sure if I am okay\nTen thousand eyes are on me\nSick of love, yet I feel so\n[Chorus]\nLovesick, I'm on a trip through astrofields\nI don't have a clue which way is up, but I know I can feel\nIf I follow that rhythm and read off the time\nI know the voices guide my shallow light: affection, space, divine\n[Verse 3]\nAnd yet I don't know why the stars aligned on that day\nIt's just too strange, I can't find a way\nWhy do I know?

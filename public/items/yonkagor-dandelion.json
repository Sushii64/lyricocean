    "lyrics": "We were both so happy\nI planted a story with him\nBut as time, as time passed, it withered\nAnd suffered with nothing to drink\n\nYet, I'm still, still wishing\nOn seedlings that sprout in the yard\nWill they grow? Will they bloom to scatter\nThe yearning within my heart?\n\nSomehow, our childhood ended there\nWhy did he leave them behind?\nThe seeds of our dreams...\n\nDandelion\nI have one more wish to make\nBefore you blow away\nDon't let him forget\nHis dearest friend\n\nDandelion\nPlease fulfill my youthful prayers\nBefore it's far too late\nCan you carry the smiles from the past?\nAnd make them last...\n\nI can hear the waters\nThe rivers won't stop and lament\nAnd I see, see the scene in black and white\nLilies without their stems\n\nSomehow, our childhood ended there\nWhy did he leave them behind?\nThe seeds of our dreams...\n\nDandelion\nI have one more wish to make\nBefore you blow away\nDon't let him forget\nHis dearest friend\n\nDandelion\nPlease fulfill my youthful prayers\nBefore it's far too late\nCan you carry the smiles from the past?\nAnd make them last...\n\nMaybe I'm just too weak\nTo accept that you'll never come back\n'Cause this meadow's too bleak\nFor you to blossom...\nDandelion\nI have one more wish to make\nBefore you blow away\n\nOh, please don't forget\nYour dearest friend!\n\nDandelion\nPlease fulfill my youthful prayers!\nBefore it's far too late\nCan you carry the smiles from the past?\nAnd make them last...\n\nDandelion\nDandelion! Woah..\nHaaah!\n\n(Make them last... make them last... make them last... Carry them from the past...)",

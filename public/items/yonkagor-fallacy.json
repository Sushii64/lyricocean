    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy mind's a broken mess\nTorn by the ones I thought were best\nI trusted them with all my heart\nAnd now we're back at start\nHealing with time and pills\nThrough hurt that breaks the strongest wills\nBut surely it's why I remain\nTo suffer through this undesired pain\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo here I lie in wait\nFor days I say it's all okay\nDays fly by with no progress there\nIt's just too much to bear\nThoughts about you\nMade me stop all the things I loved to do\nSleepless nights without a fight\nBut I still hope that you're alright\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd so I gave myself to you\nI didn't know I was used\nThose strings of fate wound up my mind\nMy naive heart took on that part\nAnd said that I'll be fine\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd once again I'm thrown into a maze of perjuries\nI lied and turned a blind eye to your lair of felonies\nAnd when it came the time for you to pay for all your crimes\nI took it all and said the fault was mine\nThough it's a fallacy\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll of this blame you gave\nWas just to make sure I behaved\nAnd in the end through severed ties\nI saw through all your lies\nInside your twisted cage\nMy blinded heart is filled with rage\nThis pain of mine was yours combined\nAnd you should be the one confined\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd so I gave myself to you\nI didn't know I was used\nThose strings of fate wound up my mind\nMy naive heart took on that part\nAnd said that I'll be fine\n\n[Bridge]\nNow that I'm free, it's all so clear to see\nThat you were the one tormenting me\nAnd in the year I thought this through and through\nThat I should be the one hating you\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd once again I'm thrown into a maze of perjuries\nI lied and turned a blind eye to your lair of felonies\nAnd when it came the time for you to pay for all your crimes\nI took it all and said the fault was mine\nThough, it's a fallacy\n\n[Outro]\nAnd now I know the truth behind your weak hypocrisy\nYou won't chain me with your guilt cause it's all words of blasphemy\nAnd now it's come the time for you to pay for all your crimes\nI won't run right now at the end of the line\n'Cause it's a fallacy",

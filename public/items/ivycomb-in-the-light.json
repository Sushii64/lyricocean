(When there's no light to see)\nHe's never breaking free (Except from his sanity)\n[Verse 1: Stephanafro]\nI can't let go\nI see your face in everything\nYou're stuck below\nA fate more fit for a king\nWhen lights are blinding\nI seek my freedom in the dark\nI'll keep on fighting\nTo see your face without your light\n[Chorus: Stephanafro]\nA king who rules his castle (Yet he has no control)\nHis kingdom's come unraveled (Already failed his goal)\nWhy does he see more clearly? (When there's no light to see)\nHe's never breaking free (Except from his sanity)\n[Verse 2: Stephanafro]\nIn the light, in the light, in the light\nIt's just a game (I feel no shame)\nIn the night, in the night, in the night\nI say your name (I take the blame)\nIn the light, in the light, in the light\nIt's just a game (I feel no shame)\nIn the night, in the night, in the night\nI say your name (I take the blame)\nIn the light, in the light, in the light\nIt's just a game (I feel no shame)\nIn the night, in the night, in the night\nI say your name (I take the blame)\nIn the light, in the light, in the light\nIt's just a game (I feel no shame)\nIn the night, in the night, in the night\nI say your name (I take the blame)",

    "lyrics": "I know I can't conceal, I know that its an ordeal\nYou found out all my moves that I can't disprove\n\nI see that you do try, I see reasons why you cry\nI see creases in your heart, as they rip apart\n\nNow I'm drunk on adhesives\nTrying to cover up stigma of mine\nBut nothing sticks and nothing stays\nAs you poke holes in my tale\n\nPlease forgive my leaking eyes\nPlease don't spoil my paradise\nHolding on to hope, shattered by\nThe one who broke my love\n\nAnd I'm crafting paper alibis\n'Cause I'm too weak for real goodbyes\nWaiting to be torn in two\n'Cause I could not tell the truth\n\nYou know I can't forget the fact you can't accept\nThe people I adored the promises we sworn\n\nCan't you see I do try and the reasons why I cry\nThese petty papercuts\nDon't turn them to a flood\n\nNow I'm drunk on adhesives\nTrying to cover up stigma of mine\nBut nothing sticks and nothing stays\nAs you poke holes in my tale\n\nI can't stand reality\nYou can't stop this agony\nDrowning in the dissonance by\nThe one who crushed our fate\n\nIn this life folded with tragedies\nWe crave for more apologies\nWishes, they all start to rust\nOur feelings burn to dust\n\nPlease forgive my leaking eyes\nPlease don't spoil my paradise\nHolding on to hope shattered\nBy the one who broke my love\n\nAnd I'm crafting paper alibis\n'Cause I'm too weak for real goodbyes\nWaitin' to be torn in two\n'Cause I could not tell the truth",

    "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nIf I was really a treasure to you\nI'm deserted by the one I trusted the most\nKnowing you'll do the same as everyone\nI'll be removed and you will be gone\n\n(Pre-Chorus 1)\n\"Please, don't ever try to leave me behind\"\nBut clearly, I know from the start, it's a lie\nSeeing you laugh with the figures you love\nTo all you call 'precious\", replace me now\n\n(Chorus 1)\nIn this world, we keep lusting for something new\nOne day slowly all will forget with it too\nFinally, we'll crave for abandonment\nThen end up discarding ourselves\n\n(Verse 2)\nIf I was really a treasure to you\nI'm deserted by the one I trusted the most\nScared that you'll do the same as everyone\nI have left you before it is done\n\n(Pre-Chorus 2)\n\"Please, don't ever try to leave me behind\"\nBut clearly, I know from the start, it's a lie\nThat time you smiled next to me who you loved\nAs you called me 'precious\", don't leave me now\n\n(Chorus 2)\nAnd somehow your hand is now out of my reach\nMy voice can be heard, but there's no way to speak\nI lied that seeing your smile from afar\nWill always be enough for me\n\n(Outro)\nAnd though\nIn this world we keep lusting for something new\nOne day slowly all will forget with it too\nIn the end, who craved for abandonment\nWas this creature I call 'myself'",

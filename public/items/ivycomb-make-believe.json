    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been countin' the days\nSince you went away\nLike clockwork in a cathedral\nYour messages are toxic in nature\nLess partner, more neighbor\nYour cold shoulder cuts\n[Chorus]\nI think that you would know that\nYou're not a dummy\nIt's so fucking funny\nTo you\nYou generate your ecstasy\nLike it's only a dream\nYou don't care to love for me\nAt all\nJust so tired of it all\nYou missed another call\nWhy even write this ensemble?\n[Post-Chorus]\nWeaving lies throughout the tale\nAll these cries you fake and wail\nWhy'd you think this was the right call?\n[Verse 2]\nWhy the need to be so cynical all the time?\nInvisibility makes it nigh to catch the light\nSing a lullaby and put your mind at ease\nConsider taking a leap of faith for me\nPlease\n[Bridge]\nBut you could never do that\nYou're just a dummy\nYou're so fucking funny\nLoser\nI wish that you could understand that\nYou're only a dream\nProject free of insecurity\n[Chorus]\nI think that you would know that\nYou're not a dummy\nIt's so fucking funny\nTo you\nYou generate your ecstasy\nLike it's only a dream\nYou don't care to love for me\nAt all\nJust so tired of it all\nYou missed another call\nWhy even write this ensemble?\n[Outro]\nWhy generate your ecstasy?\n'Cause it's only a dream\nIt's just a dream",

    "lyrics": "Hello, how have you been today?\nThe same question for the fifth time this week\nHow forgetful was that chatty cliche?\nEverything seems ordinary to me\n\nShould I tell you I've been feeling down?\n'Cause, well that's not really new\nOh well, I'll say something somehow\nThough you want to hear me ramble\nThere's not much that I can say\n\n'Cause everything seems normal\nThere's nothing to it, though\nAnd how I feel, the face I show the world\nThey all seem so slow\n\nEverything seems normal\nNo need to be upset\nDon't concern yourself with my unhappiness\n'Cause I'm sure it's normal\n\nSo, how was the party last week?\nI'm sorry that I couldn't make it\nDon't worry, it's not anything deep\nI was feeling kinda reckless in the nights I couldn't sleep\n\n'Cause everything seems normal\nThere's nothing to it, though\nAnd how I feel, the face I show the world\nThey all seem so slow\n\nEverything seems normal\nNo need to be upset\nDon't concern yourself with my unhappiness\n'Cause I'm sure it's normal...\n\n...to lose interest in life\nAnd to wish you never tried\nIsn't that what you call normal?\nThere is nothing I want\nThe only reason I went on\nIs 'Cause you'll feel regretful if I died\n\nI've written three set-aside notes\nEight attempts without any results\nBut why should my stories be told?\nThey all seem too ordinary to me\n\n'Cause everything seems normal\nThere's nothing to it, though\nAnd how I feel, the face I show the world\nThey all seem so slow\nEverything seems normal\nNo need to be upset\nDon't concern yourself with my unhappiness\n'Cause I'm sure it's normal\n\nDon't concern yourself with my unhappiness",

    "lyrics": "\"Did my refractions fade away?\"\nA thought that haunts me day by day\nLike how the foggy air and morning tears\nDissolve into the atmosphere\n\nAm I just a passing droplet?\nAm I easy to forget?\nShould I keep hoping for your warmth\nRisk my heart its brittle form\nAnd keep yearning in the storm?\n\n'Cause whenever I choose to remain\nTo linger in the rain\nIt will always end the same\nI'll mourn for your embrace  \nSomeone will surely fill my place\nYou'll leave me soaked in pain\n'Cause that's how it all plays\n\nDid I say something in the past?\nOr were my problems far too vast?\nAnd now my worries and my evening fears\nWill be the one to interfere\n\nWas I just a passing droplet?\nWas I easy to forget?\nShould I keep hoping for your warmth\nRisk my heart its brittle form\nAnd keep yearning in the storm?\n\n'Cause whenever I choose to remain\nTo linger in the rain\nIt will always end the same\nI'll mourn for your embrace  \nSomeone will surely fill my place\nYou'll leave me soaked in pain\n'Cause that's how it all plays\n\nOnce I forecasted that someday I'd be replaced\nThis restless hurricane is all too daunting to suppress\nSo no more waiting\nAnticipating\nI'll search for someone else\n\n'Cause whenever\nI chose to remain\nTo linger in the rain\nI endured a greater pain\nI've fallen from your grace\nI'll miss you, but the hurt's in vain\n\n'Cause whenever I choose to remain\nTo linger in the rain\nIt will always end the same\nI'll mourn for your embrace  \nSomeone will surely fill my place\nYou'll leave me soaked in pain\n'Cause that's how it all plays\n\nYeah, that's how it all plays",

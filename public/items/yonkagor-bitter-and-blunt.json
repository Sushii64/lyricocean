    "lyrics": "It's now the end of all the visions that we had\nYou were a friend, but we were never meant to be\nBecause the lane we took is now a broken path\nI walk away now, to resign you as a memory\n\nDid it hurt? To think I'd failed to care\nI know you felt that wasn't fair\nAnd you were weeping, gripping my tainted heart\nWhile I simply sigh from afar, asking...\n\nWhy is it comforting to know that we are done?\nAlthough these feelings are bitter and blunt?\nIt feels immoral that I celebrate alone\nThe relief is real\nI'm freed from your embrace, oh darlin'\n\nNa na na...\n\nI'm still afraid to show when I would be upset\n'Cause my emotions were for entertaining you\nI saw the crossroads that leads back to where we met\nThough I feel guilty, don't return me to that avenue\n\nDid it hurt? To think I'd failed to care\nI know you felt that wasn't fair\nAnd you were weeping, gripping my tainted heart\nWhile I simply sigh from afar, asking...\n\nWhy is it comforting to know that we are done?\nAlthough these feelings are bitter and blunt?\nIt feels immoral that I celebrate alone\nThe relief is real\nI'm freed from your embrace, oh darlin'\n\nI feel disgusted knowing that I hold a smile\n'Cause all these questions suffocate this heart of mine\nYou said it had to be you, who should plan all my future routes\nAm I wrong to want to walk with someone else?\n\nWow - whoa - oh\n\nWhy is it comforting to know that we are done?\nAlthough these feelings are bitter and blunt?\nIt feels immoral that I celebrate alone\nThe relief is real\nI'm freed from your embrace, oh darlin'",

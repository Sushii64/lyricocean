    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDid it really happen\nOr were they pieces thrown around\nThe past is all built on lies\nWhere one word could break it down\nSorting recollections\nScanning for patterns to compare\nBut nothing comes up to mind\nIn the fragments that I can't repair\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause the sweetness on your face\nAnd the tenderness of your warm embrace\nSomehow they left a bitter taste\nThere's nothing to trace\nPainful times, they were all erased\nAnd yet my body's screaming\n\"Don't make the same mistake\"\n\n[Chorus]\nCan I go ahead and surrender\nTo the visions that I just can't remember\nMerging all of these memories\nTo a blend of anomalies\nReveal all the trauma I suffered\nI'll relive it all to be born much stronger\nThen there's no way someone else can repeat\nWhat you did to me\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"Did that really happen?\"\nThoughts into voices now reshaped\nI wished for recovery\nBut was given no escape\nOnce, merely a single touch\nNow, a swarm to undertake\nIt's surely too late for me\n'Cause my limit is going to break\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow, the sweetness on your face\nAnd the tenderness of your warm embrace\nSomehow they left a bitter taste\nOh, the memories stay\nPainful times are put on replay\nAnd still, my body's screaming\n\"Don't make the same mistakes\"\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I see through all your endeavours\nAnd the sinful scars that I'll hold forever\nTainting all of these melodies\nFull of mixed-up apologies\nWas there any chance for me to run\nWas there something different that I could have done\nI'm left with a mangled mind that repeats\nWhat you did to me\n\n[Bridge]\nThere was a reason they were thrown away\nWhy they were locked behind from my display\nAnd now my memory's in disarray\nIt forced a reinstall\nRemember to forget them all\n\n[Chorus]\nCan I go ahead and surrender\nTo the visions that I just can't remember\nMerging all of these memories\nTo a blend of anomalies\nReveal all the trauma I suffered\nI'll relive it all, to be born much stronger\nThen there's no way someone else can repeat\nWhat you did to me\n\n[Outro]\nDid it really happen\nOr were they pieces thrown around\nThe past is all built on lies\nWhere one word could break it down",

    "lyrics": "{Verse 1}\nSo what's your name?\nWhat was your name?\nI can't remember something so lame\n'Cuz I don't care!\nYeah I don't care\nThat a break-up left you in despair\n\n{Pre-Chorus}\nKeep me off your track\nI don't need you back\nCrusades of guilt you put me through\nThey make. me. sick\n\n{Chorus}\nTo me your life's irrelevant\nSo don't search for significance\nThere's nothing about you I've missed\nI forgot that you exist!\n\n{Verse 2}\nSo what's it like?\nWhat is it like?\nTo leech on someone else the next night?\nYou know it's fun\nIt really is fun!\nTo hear you blame me for crimes I've never done\n\n{Pre-Chorus}\nKeep me off your track\nI don't need you back\nCrusades of guilt you put me through\nThey make. me. sick\n\n{Chorus}\nTo me your life's irrelevant\nSo don't search for significance\nThere's nothing about you I've missed\nI forgot that you exist!\n\nNa na na na naaa~\nNa-na na na na naaa~\n\n{Bridge}\nThough I've been thinking\nOf maybe forgiving...\nAm I crazy? Am I strange?\nYou'll never change...\n\n{Chorus}\nTo me your life's irrelevant\nSo don't search for significance\nThere's nothing about you I've missed\nI forgot that you exist!\nNa na na na naaa~\nNana na na na naaa~\nNa na na na naaa~\n\nMaybe one day I'll get over this\nBut for now you don't exist!\nNo, to me you don't exist!\nI forgot that you... exist!",

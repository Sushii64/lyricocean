    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI took the wrong steps, I'm sorry\nBroken and bruised, you worried\nI'm not a criminal, I just\nLost my direction in my life\nLife's fucked up\nIt's really fucked up\nI just want a keyboard\nSo I can make it up\nSticks and bones\nMay break my bones\nBut I broke her heart\nThen I broke his bones\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 2]\nI want to head home\nI really know that I'm wrong\nI just can't break through the glass\nIt can't be broken anymore\nI'm washing away\nAnd I'm stuck loathing the day\nI just have to say\nAren't you sorry too?\n[Outro]\nTook the wrong steps",

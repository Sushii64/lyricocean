    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWallow for dead crimson idols\nFall graces of insolent titles\nWhen precipice is all that's splayed\nFive feet of rope can't lead the way\n[Verse 2]\nBoundaries break at the cusp of greats\nWhen a cynical mind meets time's waiting gates\nI don't have a call to make to beings afar\n'Cause when the sky's all black, there's only one North Star!\n[Verse 3]\nWhere are the gods when the glass breaks a million times?\nA shattered aura of faith, unwelcome rhythms and rhymes\nCall into question the morrow each day to day\nA thousand voices of doubt drive all the pain away\n[Verse 4]\nAnd so I wait for the call of unreachable gods\nPlaced under layer after layer of unspeakable fraud\nI don't know what you want with me\nBut I'm too tired to stick around and see\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Bridge]\nTime is under your spell\nInfinite, until it breaks!\nRip my heart into shreds\nAnd burn the pieces\nJealousy, endlessly\nMind of body taken places\n[Verse 5]\nBoundaries broken by lies of greats\nWhen a cynical mind has no will to wait\nI don't have a call to make to beings afar\n'Cause when the sky's all black, there's only one North Star!\n[Verse 6]\nAnd so the tale's overtaken by the greed and the lust\nAt least that's what the book says, so take it how you think you must\nIt's all a fairy tale of love and joy until you're the troll\nThere's not a single thing I wish for, I have all that I told\n[Verse 7]\nI don't care to ponder it\nI know gods are full of shit\nLight they plead is shown in vain\n'Cause they don't laugh when they feel pain",

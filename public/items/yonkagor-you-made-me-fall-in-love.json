    "lyrics": "I thought that it would be another boring night\nUntil my eyes caught you where you stood, stood in sight\n'Cause on the break of day I found your secret note\nI am pulled by your strings of emotions\nI can't, can't run away now\n\nMaybe I'm fearful of your rejection or dismay\nOr maybe love isn't worth a try\n'Cause if it fails I will be taking all the blame\nSo I locked all my dreams inside\n\nCoincidentally our faces met again\nI kept stumbling, my hands trembling, I'm struggling\nEven so, you're sentimental since the day it all began\nYou are guilty of this crime you made me fall in love\n\nI really thought your gaze would fade after today\nBut I was wrong when you came right back, back this way\nAlthough I sealed away these feelings building up\nDon't you know that I've been waiting for you\nTake me, take me away now\n\nMaybe I'm fearful of all the gossip and their hate\nAnd maybe I'm not prepared to cry\nI'm just too guilty to make regrettable mistakes\nSo I kept alone my honest lies\n\nIt sounds so simple yet I'm waiting for your sign\nLove is puzzling, my hearts bubbling, it's troubling\nEven so, its incidental we found one another's lives\nAnd you stole this heart of mine, You made me fall in love\n\nCoincidentally our faces met again\nI kept stumbling, my hands trembling, I'm struggling\nEven so, you're sentimental since the day it all began\nYou are guilty of this crime you made me fall in love\n\nYeah\nFall in love!",

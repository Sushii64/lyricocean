    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's all so grey\nWhen did it all fade?\nWas it ever even there\nAt all from the start?\n(Breathe)\nIt's fallen away\nWas I ever this afraid?\nWhy am I even scared\nIf I don't have a heart?\n(Breathe)\n[Bridge]\nIf I'm this out of touch\nWhy does it hurt so much?\n[Chorus]\nI'm falling back into the floor\nTo find what I'm not searching for\nDo my own eyes deceive me?\nOr am I now seeing clearly?\nWhat do I believe in anymore?\n[Post-Chorus]\nSuspending my belief\nIs not what I had asked for\nTo leave me clueless was a gift\nThat much I'm sure\n[Verse 2]\nWas this my only purpose?\nTo be your obstacle?\nIs my life truly worthless?\nWas this all optical?\n[Verse 3]\nNow I'm connecting the dots\nAnd I've unraveled the knots\nThat kept me safe from\nA life of emptiness\nNow I'm lost in my thoughts\nStill don't know who calls the shots\nBut I can see that it's\nClearly not me\n[Verse 4]\nIt's all a lie\nWhy should I even try?\nIf I'm just an AI\nTryna play the bad guy\nI'm only worth 'bout as much\nAs this role that I've been given\nI'm just playing my part\nIn this life that I'm not living\n[Chorus]\nI'm falling back into the floor\nTo find what I'm not searching for\nDo my own eyes deceive me?\nOr am I now seeing clearly?\nWhat do I believe in anymore?\n[Post-Chorus]\nSuspending my belief\nIs not what I had asked for\nTo leave me clueless was a gift\nThat much I'm sure\n[Outro]\nBut if I made it worth it\nThen maybe I'm not worthless\nIf you can win this game\nMaybe my life won't be in vain",

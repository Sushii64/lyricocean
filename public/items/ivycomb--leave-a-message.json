    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYou have one missed voice message\nTo listen, press 7\nTo delete this message, press 8\n[Verse]\nHey, sorry, I didn't mean to miss your call\nThe radio was busted, air was frozen, I couldn't hear at all\nThe time we spent together was short-sighted and sad like the vision\nOf a seltzer bottle's contours between my homework and in-division, like\nI woke up in the morning feelin' like I couldn't breathe\nBut would that really be so bad? Living lifeless and so free, because\nWhen I was younger, they'd say, \"You should follow your dreams\"\nBut then they'd shoot it down and say, \"that wouldn't let me be free\"\nJust so many taxes and so many bills to pay\nAnd how do you expect to get a job with this failure you call your grades?\nAgainst common belief, I'm not a magic man, I'm altogether now\nBut I'm trying my best, so damn loud, proud, but not allowed\nWhy can't you just leave another message for me?\nYou've been silent for seven years, livin' wild, \nmon ami\nJe me sens si vide et seul \nsans\n toi\n, that means\nI feel so empty and alone without ya\nBut I guess reminiscing on the past is why I'm still\nAround to reminisce on said past, but a bit faster\n'Cause with each passing year that seltzer gets a little bit fuller\nLike a cloudy sky, a storm brew, a tornado of age\n[Outro]\nLook, whenever you get a chance, can you just call me back?\nIt'd be nice to hear from you again\nYou have my number\nGoodbye\nThe number you are trying to reach has been disconnected\nThank you",

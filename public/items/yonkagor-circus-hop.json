    "lyrics": "It's a comical yet devastating universe\nBut it's still the kind of universe that I deserve\nThe lipstick on my face has bled into my skin\nIt should show a grin\n\nUp from the sky, I won't want you to cry\nSo here's an act for everyone to sneer at\n\nSo sing along, it's such a silly song\nThe cackling carousel, it spins and never stops\nThe acrobat who's waiting at the top\nShould do a circus hop\n\n(Instrumental)\n\nI shall now accept the fact that I'm a failure (You're a failure)\n'Cause I'm still afraid the future might be scarier (It is scarier)\nI'll slip while having fun and cut off my own tongue\nThey'll think I was dumb\n\nUp from the sky, I won't want you to cry\nSo here's an act for everyone to sneer at\n\nSo sing along, it's such a silly song\nThe cackling carousel, it spins and never stops\nThe acrobat who's waiting at the top\nShould do a circus hop\n\n(Instrumental)\n\nI've said goodbye, I don't want you to cry\nSo have a laugh with everyone but me\n\nSo sing along, it's such a silly song\nThe cackling carousel, it spins and never stops\nThe acrobat who fell down from the top\nThey did a little drop! :)\n\nSo sing along, it's such a silly song\nThe cackling carousel, it spins and never stops\nThe acrobat who's waiting at the top\nShould do a circus hop",

    "lyrics": "[Chorus: ivycomb]\nThey tried to take me out, but I won't fold\nChose this journey when I lost my soul\nWon't take me down, won't take my throne\nDied as a sheep, but I rise as the goat\nI know that I paid the price\nNow that I'm back, bet I'm after my gold\nNever afraid to die\nFell as a sheep, but I rise as the goat, rise as the goat\n[Verse 1: Shwabadi]\nYeah, came from the bottom, I came up from nothing\nI came from the weakest, and became a demon, now everyone knows there ain't no one can stop him\nCan't no one defeat him, I wantâ€”I got it, I'm sat at the peak, at the zenith, I'm popping\nThey're tryna beef with the lamb like a carvery, so if I meet with the man, then I'm chopping\nI got a blade, several forms\nZealous intent got my fervour involved\nI get 'em shaved, fading them all\nLeaving them holey, crusader the sword\nOrcus the chop, Fornax, he pop\nVesta, the homie, he taking a shot\nCame for the crown, and I brought me a mob\nFuck with the lamb, then you fuck with a God\nImpatient, I am not the one who waits\nNo payment? I'mma send his ass away\nGot faithful men with me in every station\nFace to face with me; they learn their place\nBlade to blade; I might send him up\nAscending opps, I send 'em off with no ritual\nTryna take the top? They need a miracle\nDig a pit, and drop him in, he pitiful\nDrip too cold, drip too clean\nGolden on me, copped another fleece\nSacrifice the cost, I know 'bout loss\nHow you think I made it to the peak?\nHolding on, won't falter, now I'm free\nBroken once, but conquered those defeats\nI was out, but now I count my keep\nRise the goat, inside had died the sheep\n[Chorus: ivycomb]\nThey tried to take me out, but I won't fold\nChose this journey when I lost my soul\nWon't take me down, won't take my throne\nDied as a sheep, but I rise as the goat\nI know that I paid the price\nNow that I'm back, bet I'm after my gold\nNever afraid to die\nFell as a sheep, but I rise as the goat, rise as the goat\n[Verse 2: Shwabadi]\nEver underestimated\nNever less than what I made it\nDesecrated temples to their old gods\nWhen I showed them all that I'm the greatest\nThen I showed them all why I'm their favorite\nCraft community, and elevate it\nNothing left of mine, don't hold devotion\nNothing left that I'm not holding sacred\nNothing left to find in the forest, I've sent 'em off from that place\nBurned all the webs of Shamura, went to Anura, made Heket red in the face\nMade Calamari outta Kallamar, he couldn't counter curses and blades\nFuck taking orders, I could cut down the cat where he waits\n[Chorus: ivycomb]\nThey tried to take me out, but I won't fold\nChose this journey when I lost my soul\nWon't take me down, won't take my throne\nDied as a sheep, but I rise as the goat\nI know that I paid the price\nNow that I'm back, bet I'm after my gold\nNever afraid to die\nFell as a sheep, but I rise as the goat\nThey tried to take me out, but I won't fold\nChose this journey when I lost my soul\nWon't take me down, won't take my throne\nDied as a sheep, but I rise as the goat\nI know that I paid the price\nNow that I'm back, bet I'm after my gold\nNever afraid to die\nFell as a sheep, but I rise as the goat, rise as the goat",

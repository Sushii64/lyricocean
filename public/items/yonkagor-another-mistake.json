    "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nI lost desire, I never meant to leave\nI'm traumatized by excessive sympathy\nI kept on loving the people who are wrong\nUntil my heart got swept along\n\n(Pre-Chorus 1)\nWhy do I keep on trying?\nI just end up lyin'\n\n(Chorus 1)\nCome on, does it matter if it's fake?\nCome on, when it's real it's just another mistake\nSo why would you hold on til' you break?\nWhy won't you go? You won't matter anyway\n\n(Verse 2)\nYou're seeking answers for the toying you've been through\nGrasping for proof that's been locked away from you\nI was a dream and the one you're looking for\nBut now I can't love anymore\n\n(Pre-Chorus 2)\nIf only time could rewind\nFix my own broken mind\n\n(Chorus 2)\nCome on, now it's already too late\nCome on, it's time I reached my expiry date\nGoodbye, my mind begins to break\n‘Cause once I'm gone, I won't matter anyway\n\n(Chorus 1)\nCome on, does it matter if it's fake?\nCome on, when it's real it's just another mistake\nSo why would you hold on til' you break?\nWhy won't you go? You won't matter anyway\n\n(Outro)\nCome on, does it matter if it's fake?\nCome on, how I feel is just another mistake\nSo I kept on lying for your sake\nWhy won't you go? You won't matter anyway",

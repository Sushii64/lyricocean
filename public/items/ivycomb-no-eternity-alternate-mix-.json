    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nTime is under your spell\nInfinite, until it breaks!\nRip my heart into shreds\nAnd burn the pieces\nJealousy, endlessly\nMind of body taken places\n[Verse 1]\nBoundaries broken by lies of greats\nWhen a cynical mind has no will to wait\nI don't have a call to make to beings afar\n'Cause when the sky's all black, there's only one North Star!\n[Verse 2]\nAnd so the tale's overtaken by the greed and the lust\nAt least that's what the book says, so take it how you think you must\nIt's all a fairy tale of love and joy until you're the troll\nThere's not a single thing I wish for, I have all that I told\n[Verse 3]\nI don't care to ponder it\nI know gods are full of shit\nLight they plead is shown in vain\n'Cause they don't laugh when they feel pain",

- make the json update if it's out of date
- add more songs
- make the homepage let you search for the artist and the song name in the same search along with one of the other

maybe: 
- make the homepage have a list of artists that you can search and then the normal song list from there where you can search for their songs
    - maybe an artist db that it matches the "artist" in the song data with the "name" in the artist data
    - that way the artists could have images
    - urls like this
        / <- as normal, but would now host the artist list
        /artist/<name>
        /song/<song name> <- as normal
